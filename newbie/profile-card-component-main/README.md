## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned

Background-position can take two directional values like so:
```css
div {
  background-position: top left;
}
```

### Continued development

This project looks more simple than it turned out to be in practice. It is ranked as 'newbie' which is appropriate, and yet it took me way longer than I ever would have guessed. I will return to this one at another time and see if the time to complete it has improved.
