### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Media-queries
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I have a pretty good feel for Flexbox at this point but still have some things to figure out. For example, getting the spacing right on these repeating elements required a lot of tweaking, and I didn't really anticipate much of these problems. I look forward to getting a bit more practice doing layout with Flexbox and improving my workflow when using it.
