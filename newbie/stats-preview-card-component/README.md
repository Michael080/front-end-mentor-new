## Overview
The challenge was to build a responsive custom card component with mobile and desktop views. The design files for this project were exclusively jpeg screenshots of the file design so that much of the layout was done "by eye".
### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

## My process

-Build the skeleton of the design in html.
- Match design colors and fonts.
- The layout of the card which can be viewed as two-sections, an image section, and a content section was achieved using a flex container w/ media queries to transition from column to row layout.
- The image was implemented using CSS background-blend-modes.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

There is a lot of centering involved in this design which can get quite cumbersome especially when creating a responsive layout using basic CSS. I found flexbox to be the most handy thing for simplifying the solution.

### Continued development

I am not sure but grid may be useful for layout of the content-section of the card. Familiarizing myself some more on the subject would probably answer the question so that is something to work on in the future.

### Useful resources

- [Font Matcherator](https://www.fontspring.com/matcherator) - Before finding the provided style guide I was trying to match the fonts in the .jpeg and stumbled onto this site which was a useful tool for finding, not the exact font, but one that was very close.
